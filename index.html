                Python Spell Checker
                <p>
                    Using python, I make a hash map that acts as a database for both correct and incorrectly spelled
                    words. The program parses through text files, corrects the errors and prints the properly spelled
                    text.

                Javascript Sudoku solver
                <p>
                    Since solving sudoku puzzles is one of my favorite past times, I created a sudoku solver(work in progress)
                    that uses functions based off the logic necessary to solve sudoku puzzles. At the moment it handles
                    all the basic logical steps and then uses brute force. I will continually have updated versions with
                    more complex solution capabilities.

                Java WebCheckers
                <p>
                    WebCheckers is one of the team projects I worked on where we followed a scrum methodology and created
                    an online checkers game. Users can make accounts, store games, and play other players through the internet
                    in a game of checkers.
